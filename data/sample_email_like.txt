Subject: Request for permit status on [[PII:FILE_NO]] DP-24-1682

Hi team,

I am following up on the review status for the project at [[PII:ADDRESS]] 1186 Cedar Ridge Ave, Victoria, BC. We are trying to coordinate a revised site plan and need clarity on the remaining items. Timeline is tight and we are aiming for approval within 6 weeks.
