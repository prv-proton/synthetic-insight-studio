Parcel ref: [PARCEL_ID].\nQuestions:\n1) Do we need a Riparian Areas Protection Regulation assessment given a seasonal creek ~18m south of the lot?\n2) Can we submit municipal DP and Building Permit in parallel if our zoning is compliant (R-2 infill)?\n3) What is the sequence for stormwater review vs arborist report to minimize rework?\nAttachments (drafts):\n- [ATTACHMENT] 2025-02-10_CedarRidge_SitePlan_DRAFT.pdf\n- [ATTACHMENT] 2025-02-10_Prelim_StormReport_MONROE.pdf\nThanks,\n[NAME]  [PHONE]\n\nReply (Navigator):\n- 18m proximity likely triggers riparian review; request QEP letter + SPEA mapping.\n- DP before BP is preferred, but concurrent intake may be accepted with strong zoning conformity memo + coordinated civil package.\n- Arborist report first so tree protection zones inform stormwater layout.\nRequest: share topo + QEP scoping letter for local nuance check.\n\nFollow-up (Requester):\nQuestion: rear lane dedication covenant [LEGAL]—impact on parking count or access geometry? Mixed guidance.\n\nReply (Navigator):\nCovenant mainly impacts access geometry; stall counts per current zoning/bylaw. Will confirm with transportation reviewer."}

Our lender is asking for updated milestones [FINANCING]. We heard there were stormwater comments but haven’t received them directly.\nCould you share:\n- Which agencies have returned comments\n- Any must-fix items blocking circulation\nThanks,\n[NAME] [PHONE]\n\nReply (Navigator) — Status summary:\n- Municipal Engineering: updated hydrologic calcs for 1:10 and 1:100 storm; confirm infiltration rates using on-site testing.\n- Planning: minor revision to front setback.\n- Fire: turning template for truck Aerial 18 tight at SE corner; requires swept path revision.\n- Env/Province: awaiting QEP memo on swale; pending but not a stop.\nBlocking items: stormwater calcs + fire access. Suggest coordinated resubmission to avoid second cycle. Offer 20-min coordination call.\n\nFollow-up (Requester):\nCivil can submit by Thursday. Fire access tricky—lane width fixed.\nQuestion: If swept path is met with a mountable curb detail, will Fire accept? Also, term sheet expires [DATE] [FINANCING]. Can we clear comments by early June if we submit this week?\n\nReply (Navigator):\nMountable curb has precedent; Fire typically accepts if path shows no encroachment beyond curb face and radii meet spec. Timing possible but contingent on complete package."}

Common resolution: narrow landscape buffer to 1.2–1.5 m at pinch points + use columnar species for screening. Consider stall depth adjustments/overhang into landscape or restriping if allowed. Will convene Fire + Planning and return unified note.\n\nFollow-up (Requester):\nPlease confirm if tapered throat geometry is acceptable for first 8 m; traffic engineer says it preserves emergency turning paths."}
